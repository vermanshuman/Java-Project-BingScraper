Bing Scraper (originally Google Scraper)

The purpose of this program is to take a search query and
and output file and return the top 5 search result links 
for that particular query from bing.com. The parser
essentially "borrows" the html code from the bing search
result page and outputs the first 5 results. A typical run
of the program looks like:
 
     -q "University of Georgia" -o "results.txt"
